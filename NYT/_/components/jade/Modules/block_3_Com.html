We do around 15 of these special issues every year, and they provide us with an opportunity to take a different approach to the magazine. I would say that some of the more innovative work we&rsquo;ve done since The New York Issue came in special issues, like the November Design Issue, which was about redesigns, for which we asked design firms around the world to reimagine everyday objects or processes like the toilet, the hospital gown, or the baggage claim carousel. In December we created a series of virtual-reality films with Hollywood&rsquo;s top actors for our Great Performers Issue. The films were innovative in how they used VR to bring the viewer inside the scene with the actor. For our Music Issue in February, we created a playlist of 25 songs that give us some hints about where music is headed, along with a great podcast that let the writers inhabit the songs.</td>

Those films have been some of the most interesting projects of the past couple of years. Now that we&rsquo;ve been doing it awhile, it&rsquo;s no longer a brand-new tool, it&rsquo;s just another of the ways we can tell stories and bring readers up close to the subjects we&rsquo;re covering. VR is always something we think about. But we tend to save it for 
special occasions.

As to the second question, we are always making little adjustments here and there, improving this page or that one, bringing in new columnists, etc. We just launched a new feature that I&rsquo;m very excited about. It&rsquo;s called “New Sentences,” and the basic idea is that we&rsquo;ll be doing mini-reviews of a single sentence from a new book, movie, song, TV show and so on. All these new cultural products that we relentlessly consume are made of sentences, and if the work is good, the sentences have to be fresh, original and new. So we&rsquo;ll be plucking out a single sentence and doing a very close reading of it. Part of the pleasure of this is the intensity of a good close reading.</td>

A lot of that has to do with the difference between a monthly and a true weekly that has to publish an issue every single Sunday. There&rsquo;s far less time on a weekly to make a plan, revise the plan, revise the revision, etc. The rhythm is completely different. Things always have to keep moving, with very little downtime. That took some getting used to, but I much prefer this rhythm, in part because it means we have 52 shots to make something great each year. Now that I&rsquo;ve been in this position, the idea of having only 12 shots seems terrible!</td>

We had the idea to approach it like a magazine front-of-book, a collection of small features that are easy and fun to quickly digest. It has humor, illustration and a different tone of voice than the rest of the newspaper. It&rsquo;s a new way to begin.  </td>
