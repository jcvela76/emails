What do you see as some of the magazine’s more innovative issues since then?</td>

We do around 15 of these special issues every year, and they provide us with an opportunity to take a different approach to the magazine. I would say that some of the more innovative work we’ve done since The New York Issue came in special issues, like the November Design Issue, which was about redesigns, for which we asked design firms around the world to reimagine everyday objects or processes like the toilet, the hospital gown, or the baggage claim carousel. In December we created a series of virtual-reality films with Hollywood’s top actors for our Great Performers issue. The films were innovative in how they used VR to bring the viewer inside the scene with the actor. For our Music Issue in February, we created a playlist of 25 songs that give us some hints about where music is headed, along with a great podcast that let the writers inhabit the songs.</td>
